As part of the Google Cloud Challenge Lab, I completed an end-to-end deployment pipeline for a GenAI-powered culinary assistant app 👨‍🍳, and I’m thrilled to share the journey:

🔹 UI + Prompt Engineering
🔧 Customized chef.py using the Streamlit framework, creating a dynamic UI with variables like cuisine, dietary needs, allergies, ingredients, and wine preferences 🍷
🧠 Engineered a multi-variable custom Gemini prompt to generate smart, personalized recipe recommendations—complete with instructions, nutrition info, and wine pairings!

🔹 App Testing in Cloud Shell
✅ Setup a Python virtual environment, installed dependencies, configured environment variables, and successfully ran the application locally in Cloud Shell without errors.

🔹 Dockerize & Artifact Push
🐳 Modified the Dockerfile to build the Streamlit app container
📦 Pushed the image to Artifact Registry using gcloud builds submit, ensuring secure, scalable container management

🔹 Cloud Run Deployment
🚀 Deployed the Docker image to Google Cloud Run, configured unauthenticated access, and tested the live application via the public service endpoint.

🌐 The result? A fully functional, AI-driven web app that generates healthy, allergen-conscious recipes paired with wine suggestions—powered by Vertex AI's Gemini model and hosted serverlessly via Cloud Run.

This hands-on experience enhanced my skills in:
🔹 GenAI prompt design
🔹 Full-stack AI application development
🔹 Docker + Artifact Registry
🔹 Google Cloud Run deployments
🔹 Infrastructure-as-Code practices

Ready to keep building smarter, scalable AI applications! 💡✨
